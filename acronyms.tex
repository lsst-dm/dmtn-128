BAC & Budget At Complete \\\hline
Broker & Software which receives and redistributes Alerts, and may also perform processing such as filtering for certain characteristics, cross-matching with non-LSST catalogs, and/or light-curve classification, in order to identify and prioritize targets for follow-up and/or make scientific analyses.  \\\hline
Butler & A middleware component for persisting and retrieving image datasets (raw or processed), calibration reference data, and catalogs \\\hline
CC & Change Control \\\hline
CCOB & Camera Calibration Optical Bench \\\hline
Camera & The LSST subsystem responsible for the 3.2-gigapixel LSST camera, which will take more than 800 panoramic images of the sky every night.

DRP & Data Release Production \\\hline
Data Access Center & Part of the LSST Data Management System, the US and Chilean DACs will provide authorized access to the released LSST data products, software such as the Science Platform, and computational resources for data analysis. The US DAC also includes a service for distributing bulk data on daily and annual (Data Release) timescales to partner institutions, collaborations, and LSST Education and Public Outreach (EPO).  \\\hline
Data Management & The LSST Subsystem responsible for the Data Management System (DMS), which will capture, store, catalog, and serve the LSST dataset to the scientific community and public. The DM team is responsible for the DMS architecture, applications, middleware, infrastructure, algorithms, and Observatory Network Design. DM is a distributed team working at LSST and partner institutions, with the DM Subsystem Manager located at LSST headquarters in Tucson \\\hline
Data Release Production & An episode of (re)processing all of the accumulated LSST images, during which all output DR data products are generated. These episodes are planned to occur annually during the LSST survey, and the processing will be executed at the Archive Center. This includes Difference Imaging Analysis, generating deep Coadd Images, Source detection and association, creating Object and Solar System Object catalogs, and related metadata \\\hline

Offer & A response to a solicitation that, if accepted, would bind the offeror to perform the work described in resultant contract. Responses to sealed bidding are offers that are often referred to as 'bids' or 'sealed bids;' responses to a request for proposals (RFP, negotiated-type procurements) are offers often referred to as 'proposals' responses to a request for quotations (RFQ) are not offers and are generally called 'quotes' \\\hline
Operations & The 10-year period following construction and commissioning during which the LSST Observatory conducts its survey \\\hline
Operations Rehearsal & A data management system prototype project employing the same methods, tools, personnel, and technologies as the real system in order to introduce and validate new algorithms, functionality, and infrastructure. Previously referred to as a data challenge \\\hline
PCW & Project Community Workshop \\\hline
PSF & Point Spread Function \\\hline
Project Manager & The person responsible for exercising leadership and oversight over the entire LSST project; he or she controls schedule, budget, and all contingency funds \\\hline
Prompt Processing & The processing that occurs at the Archive Center on the nightly stream of raw images coming from the telescope, including Difference Imaging Analysis, Alert Production, and the Moving Object Processing System. This processing generates Prompt Data Products \\\hline
Qserv & Proprietary Database built by SLAC for LSST \\\hline
Release & Publication of a new iteration of an existing document following approval of changes through the change control process. Upon release, the new iteration becomes the current baseline and the preferred version in the archive \\\hline
Review & Programmatic and/or technical audits of a given component of the project, where a preferably independent committee advises further project decisions, based on the current status and their evaluation of it. The reviews assess technical performance and maturity, as well as the compliance of the design and end product with the stated requirements and interfaces \\\hline

SUIT & Science User Interface and Tools \\\hline
Science Pipelines & The library of software components and the algorithms and processing pipelines assembled from them that are being developed by DM to generate science-ready data products from LSST images. The Pipelines may be executed at scale as part of LSST Prompt or Data Release processing, or pieces of them may be used in a standalone mode or executed through the LSST Science Platform. The Science Pipelines are one component of the LSST Software Stack \\\hline
Science Platform & A set of integrated web applications and services deployed at the LSST Data Access Centers (DACs) through which the scientific community will access, visualize, and perform next-to-the-data analysis of the LSST data products \\\hline
