\frame{{Data Release Production}

  \begin{itemize}
   \item   {\textbf{LDM-503-07: Camera Data Processing}: Level 2 milestone demonstrating basic processing of data from \emph{physical LSST hardware} through Science Pipelines.}

        \item{The DRP team undertook a very successful ``sprint'' to integrate the SCARLET deblender \citep{2018A&C....24..129M} into the LSST Science Pipelines; it can now be run as part of regular LSST processing.}
            \item{The DRP team have integrated a version of the Forward Global Calibration Model \citep[FGCM;][]{2018AJ....155...41B} with the LSST Pipelines, and have extended it to provide absolute photometric calibration with respect to a reference catalog.}
 \item{A first protytpe of the one-dimensional spectral extraction pipeline designed to reduce data produced by the Auxiliary Telescope Spectrograph has been produced.}
           \item{Delivered partial mitigation for the brighter-fatter effect \citep{2014JInst...9C3048A}.}

  \end{itemize}

\frame{\frametitle{Base \& Network}
\begin{itemize}
\item Demonstrated 100\,Gbps from Base to NCSA in November at Supercomputing 2018.
\item 10\,TB of DECam data via SCInet via Miami -- Dallas -- Chicago.
\item Jupyter notebook used to monitor process from Data Transfer Node to disk at NCSA.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Catalog Database (Qserv):
                \begin{itemize}
                   \item Currently hosting $\approx$ 175 TB across 30 nodes.
                     \begin{itemize}
                        \item NCSA: science dataset (Stripe 82 + WISE; Gaia DR2 soon).
                        \item CC-IN2P3: synthetic datasets.
                    \end{itemize}
                    \item Will scale to 75\% LSST DR1 by late 2019.
                    \item Cloud Deployment Demonstration \citedsp{DMTN-125}.

\frame{\frametitle{LSST Data Facility (NCSA)}

\begin{itemize}
\item L2 Milestones completed: LDM-503-8b, LDM-503-8, LDM-503-4, LDM-503-4b.  % Would be good to say what these actually are!

\item Spectrograph integration tests, culminating in running prompt forwarder \& archiver processes on LATISS test stand in Tucson. Data is made available in ``Butler'' repositories at the Data Facility (caveat not optimal nor final).
\item Delivered multiple services: Kubernetes, Qserv, HTCondor. Plus authorization \& authentication support to LSST  in Chile.
\item Demonstrated Pegasus Workflow Management System (on HTCondor) and ``Butler'' based on an Oracle database running with ``Generation 3'' DM middleware. Since decided to go direct to HTCondor (dropping Pegasus).
\item Integrated of Camera Data Acquisition hardware on the L1 Test Stand at NCSA; provided a tutorial on the new software interface.
\item Led Operations Rehearsal \#1 to prepare for commissioning by simulating nominal operations during a three-day observation period.
\item Procured and configured test systems for ComCam; supplied to Tucson.

\end{itemize}

\frame{\frametitle{SQuaRE}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Notebook Aspect of the Science Platform now well established.
  \item New InfluxDB back-end for the SQuaSH (metrics curation) service.
  \item Also new: automated report creation from notebook templates.
  \item Prototyped DM Engineering \& Facility Database based on Kafka \& InfluxDB; demonstrated impressive scaling to 50\,Hz.
