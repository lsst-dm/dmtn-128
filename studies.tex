\begin{itemize}
\item Google
\begin{itemize}
\item Initial cost estimates based on a simplified sizing model (\citeds{DMTN-072}) formed basis.
\item Report in \citeds{DMTN-125} --- highlights include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Deployed Qserv on Google with reasonable performance (80\% or better of in-house)
\item Data transfer adequate for Prompt Processing demonstrated, within the limits of the available network. Prompt Product Database stood up and tested.
\item Science Platform deployed and users simulated.
\end{itemize}
\item Successfully viability of the ideas, but more effort would be required to take this further.
\end{itemize}
\item AWS
\begin{itemize}
\item Processing with Amazon Web Services / Elastic Compute Cloud and HTCondor.
\item Investigation currently underway, being lead by Hsin-Fang Chiang (NCSA).
\item See \citeds{DMTN-114} for details --- goals include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Demonstrate HSC data processing test on Amazon, integrated with their S3 object storage system; ultimately, scale to large data volumes.
\item Stretch: Reprocess DESC DC2.
\item Stretch: Offer tutorial at \href{https://petabytestoscience.github.io/workshop-iii}{Data Inclusion Revolution in Boston in November}
\end{itemize}
